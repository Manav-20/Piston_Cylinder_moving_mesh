# Cold-Flow Piston–Cylinder Simulation (OpenFOAM)

## 📌 Overview
This case simulates **cold-flow in a piston–cylinder engine** using OpenFOAM’s **dynamic mesh** capability.  
The focus is on **mesh deformation** and **in-cylinder flow physics** (pressure rise, vortices) without combustion.  

It is based on the `engineFoam/kivaTest` tutorial and modified for **cold-flow**.

## ⚙️ Solver
- Recommended solver:  
  - `icoDyMEngine` (incompressible piston solver) **or**  
  - `rhoPimpleDyMFoam` (compressible cold-flow).  

- Combustion is **disabled** (`combustion off;` in `constant/combustionProperties`).
